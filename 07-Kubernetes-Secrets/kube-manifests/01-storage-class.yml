# Note - 1:
#volumeBindingMode: Immediate - This setting implies that the PersistentVolumecreation, 
#followed with the storage medium (Azure Disk in this case) provisioning is triggered as 
#soon as the PersistentVolumeClaim is created.

# Note - 2:
# volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer 
#By default, the Immediate mode indicates that volume binding and dynamic provisioning 
#occurs once the PersistentVolumeClaim is created. For storage backends that are 
#topology-constrained and not globally accessible from all Nodes in the cluster, 
#PersistentVolumes will be bound or provisioned without knowledge of the Pod's scheduling 
#requirements. This may result in unschedulable Pods.
#A cluster administrator can address this issue by specifying the WaitForFirstConsumer 
#mode which will delay the binding and provisioning of a PersistentVolume until a 
#Pod using the PersistentVolumeClaim is created. PersistentVolumes will be selected or 
#provisioned conforming to the topology that is specified by the Pod's scheduling 
#constraints.

# Note - 3: 
#reclaimPolicy: Delete - With this setting, as soon as a PersistentVolumeClaim is deleted, 
#it also triggers the removal of the corresponding PersistentVolume along with the 
#Azure Disk. 
#We will be surprised provided if we intended to retain that data as backup.
# reclaimPolicy: retain -  Disk is retained even when PVC is deleted - Recommended Option

# Note - 4:
# Both reclaimPolicy: Delete and volumeBindingMode: Immediate are default settings
